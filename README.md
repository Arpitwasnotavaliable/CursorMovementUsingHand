# CursorMovement with Hand Motion

This project enables **cursor movement control** using **hand gestures** captured through a camera or a motion sensor. The system uses real-time hand tracking algorithms to detect hand positions and translates them into mouse movements on the screen, offering a touch-free way to interact with your device.

### Features:
- **Real-time hand tracking** for precise cursor control.
- Gesture-based interface to control movement, clicks, and scrolling.
- Works with any camera or motion capture device that supports real-time tracking.
- Minimal setup required for easy integration.

### Technologies:
- **Python** (for hand tracking and interaction logic)
- **OpenCV** (for computer vision)
- **MediaPipe** (for hand gesture detection)
- Optional: **PyAutoGUI** (for simulating mouse actions)

### Requirements:
- Python 3.7+ 
- Dependencies: 
  - OpenCV
  - MediaPipe
  - PyAutoGUI (or similar)

### Installation:
To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
